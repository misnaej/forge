"""The three surfaces a forge install presents, read once for every checker.

One install exposes its version three ways — the pip ``forge-scripts``
distribution, the gitignored ``.githooks/.forge-hook-version`` sidecar the
hook installer writes, and the cached Claude Code plugin — and they drift
independently: a pull adds an entry point the install lacks, a failed
self-refresh leaves the hooks behind, a merged plugin release sits unloaded
in the cache. ``forge-doctor`` reports the skew as an advisory and
``forge-precommit``'s ``env_sync`` / ``plugin_sync`` steps block on it, so
the readers live here once and both consumers see the same numbers and
name the same remediation.
